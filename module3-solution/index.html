          <h2>Chicken</h2>
          One day Chicken Licken is under a nut tree in the farmyard.
           A nut falls on her head. She thought the sky is falling.
            She runs to tell her friends in the farmyard the news.
             At the end, when they come to know what actually happened,
              they feel silly and foolish for believing Chicken Licken.
              Once upon a time, there were a farm. Most of the animals on the
               farm were happy. But Chicken Licken was not happy.
               Chicken Licken was a scary cat, afraid of every thing.
               Suddenly, a small acorn dropped from the tree and hit Chicken 
               Licken’s scalp. Chicken Licken didn’t see the acorn. 
               He looked up at the blue sky. “Oh no! ” he said. 
               “The sky must be falling. “
               Chicken Licken ran around the tree. 
               “The sky is falling! The sky is falling! ” he cried.
                “I must tell this to the King,” thought Chicken Licken.
                 He hurried back to the farmyard.

Henny Penny was sitting by the hen house.

“Out of my way! ” screamed Chicken Licken.

“What’s the matter? ” asked Henny Penny.

“The sky is falling!” cried Chicken Licken.
“Oh no!” said Henny Penny. “What shall we do?”
“I’m going to alert the King, ” said Chicken Licken.

“I’ll come too,” said Henny Penny.
They ran past the hen house and… Thump! They knocked into Cocky Locky.
